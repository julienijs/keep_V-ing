# The grammaticalization of *keep*
This repository hosts the code and data for my analysis of the grammaticalization of the verb *keep*.

In present day English the verb *keep* occurs in two related constructions, where it serves an auxiliary-like function. It is used as a continuative marker in the *keep (on) + Verb-ing* construction (1) and in the older complex-transitive construction (2) (De Smet 2013: 204-206).

1. She keeps (on) dancing.
2. She kept the fire burning.

The data was collected from the EMMA corpus (Petré et al. 2019). Like Petré and Van de Velde (2018) this study relies on grammaticalization scores to create a distributional profile of the two constructions with *keep*. Seven variables were taken into account: 
1. innovativeness of the ing-form (top 15 collocates) 
2. bondedness
3. inclusion of an explicit continuative marker
4. animacy of the subject
5. presence of a motion verb
6. telicity of the verb
7. coordination with an adjective
