# The grammaticalization of *keep*
This repository hosts the code and data for my analysis of the grammaticalization of the verb *keep*.

In present day English the verb *keep* occurs in two related constructions, where it serves an auxiliary-like function. It is used as a continuative marker in the *keep (on) + Verb-ing* construction (1) and in the older complex-transitive construction (2) (De Smet 2013: 204-206).

1. She keeps (on) dancing.
2. She kept the fire burning.

See also [this repository](https://github.com/julienijs/Search_EMMA_Corpus) for my query of the *keep + V-ing* pattern in the EMMA corus.

## Data and code

The data was collected from the EMMA corpus (Petré et al. 2019). Like Petré and Van de Velde (2018) this study relies on grammaticalization scores to create a distributional profile of the two constructions with *keep*. Seven variables were taken into account: 
a)	innovativeness of the -ing participle
b)	adjectiveness of the -ing participle
c)	coordination with an adjective
d)	animacy of the subject
e)	aktionsart
f)	durative/iterative
g)	voluntariness
h)	bondedness
