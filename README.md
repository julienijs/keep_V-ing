# The grammaticalization of *keep*
This repository hosts the code and data for my analysis of the grammaticalization of the verb *keep*.

In present day English the verb *keep* occurs in two related constructions, where it serves an auxiliary-like function. It is used as a continuative marker in the *keep (on) + Verb-ing* construction (1) and in the older complex-transitive construction (2) (De Smet 2013: 204-206).

1. She keeps (on) dancing.
2. She kept the fire burning.

## Data and code

The data was collected from the EMMA corpus (Petré et al. 2019). Like Petré and Van de Velde (2018) this study relies on grammaticalization scores to create a distributional profile of the two constructions with *keep*. Seven variables were taken into account: 
1. innovativeness of the ing-form (top 15 collocates) 
2. bondedness
3. inclusion of an explicit continuative marker
4. animacy of the subject
5. presence of a motion verb
6. coordination with an adjective
